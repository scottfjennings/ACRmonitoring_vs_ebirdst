Comparing estimates of bird population change from Audubon Canyon Ranch long term monitoring to eBird status and trend estimates  

** This material uses data from the eBird Status and Trends Project at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, eBird.org. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.  


Audubon Canyon Ranch has maintained 3 long-term monitoring projects:  

* Heron and egret nesting in the San Francisco North bay  
* Shorebirds on Tomales Bay  
* Waterbirds on Tomales Bay  


We calculate % change in estimated abundance for several species monitored by these projects.  

Trend estimates for many species are also available from eBird (maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology) as eBird Status and Trends data products: https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends
